# Cliff-Jump
This is a video game project, **Cliff Jump**.
---
## Project Abstract
Cliff Jump is a two player game where the two opponents jump off their respective cliffs on adjacent sides of the screen and fall through the air towards the bottom where there are moving trampolines. Players must bounce off those trampolines. If they miss a trampoline they die and lose the game. After players successfully bounce off the moving trampolines at the ground, they shoot back into the air and will then come down through gravity to bounce off the trampolines again. One notable thing is that the trampolines each have life spans. These life spans are determined by damage to the trampoline due to players bouncing off of them. Each trampoline can handle 4 consecutive player bounces before it disintegrates and will not re-spawn until each player has cycled through 3 additional bounces post trampoline disintegration. The game is won when one player falls to their death while the other player does not. We are determining if the game will be a network game or multiplayer with a shared keyboard.

## Stretch Features
If time permits, we plan to have different levels to the game. These progressing levels will increase in gameplay difficulty. Some ideas of how to do this are to make the trampolines at the bottom of the screen move faster as players progress through levels as well as decreasing the total number of trampolines at the bottom for the players to bounce off of. In order to create ascending levels, there must be a set competition to each level. This could be done by a time limit for levels or as a total number of bounces to achieve before each level is complete. After the completion of a level, the two players will bounce extra high and back onto the ledges of their respective cliffs. A level complete modal will display on the screen and the game will be reset for the start of the next level.

## Stretch Theme Ideas
Make each levels gravity different. Start on the moon with low gravity and keep increasing it as levels progress and give the levels themes like moon level, mars level, Saturn level, earth level etc. Maybe have as many levels as planets in solar system. Ending with Sun level.
